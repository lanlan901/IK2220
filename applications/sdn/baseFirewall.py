# This is the basic Firewall class which implements all features of your firewall!
# For upcoming packets, you should decide if the packet is allowed to pass according to the firewall rules (which you have provided in networkFirewalls file during initialization.)
# After processing packets you should install the correct OF rule on the device to threat similar packets the same way on dataplane (without forwarding packets to the controller) for a specific period of time.

# rules format:
# [input_HW_port, protocol, src_ip, src_port, dst_ip, dst_port, allow/block]
# Checkout networkFirewalls.py file for detailed structure.
